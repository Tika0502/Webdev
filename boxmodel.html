	<p id="content1">Who is your creator? Where are you going? You think you live forever with this pride!? Remember Tilyekbyerdi, You are nobody. You are just a drop of a sperm.

	<p id="content2">Oh my Lord, There has been no value of Sleeping, Eating, Laughing, Playing, Studying. Ya Rabb, help your slave, help this arrogant, lazy slave. Indeed, You are purely the most gracious, and I am among the wrongdoers.

<div>
	<q id="corner3"> Al-Wali
	<p id="content3">There is no deity worthy of worship except you. Therefore, oh my lord, I never lose my trust in you, even I take myself deep inside of despair. I always try to be happy, encouraged, brave, and be disciplined. Ya Rabb, Your slave loves you. No matter how many times or how I fail, I won't give up to until I obtain the wisdom from you.
